# Android Form Support for DevTrac (via OnaData)

##  Summary
 
The ability to collect information via mobile phones is an important functionality of DevTrac as it’s intended to capture what’s on the ground during site visits by UNICEF staff.  Currently, mobile data collection is only supported by BlackBerry phones.  The purpose of this proposed project is to create a bridge between Ona Data - an open source mobile data collection platform and DevTrac to allow mobile data collection via Android and/or mobile friendly web forms.  To achieve this a bridge web-service will be created that will allow the mapping between data collection forms hosted in Ona Data and DevTrac site visit form and other events via DevTrac’s Drupal based API.  This will allow a user of Ona Data to submit data via an Android using ODK Collect or a mobile friend webform and have it automatically show up in DevTrac.
 
## Deliverables
 
* Creation of a bridge web service that will facilitate the mapping of forms hosted in OnaData to a corresponding DevTrac site visit form.  A simple UI will be created to allow new mappings without requiring a programmer to be involved.
* Creation of Site Visit forms via XLSForm to be loaded in OnaData. 
* Mapping of the Ona Data forms into the corresponding Site Visit forms and testing to make sure they work.
* Location registration form - Ability to register new sites via the Ona Data form.

Note: for this version the site ID (node ID) will have to be passed manually.  Future versions will allow passing the ID of existing locations into the form.
